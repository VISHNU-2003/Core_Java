//                     Running the code you provided in an infinite loop would repeatedly print the statement "Apna College" indefinitely.

// The reason for this behavior is that the code you provided is a for loop with an empty initialization, condition, and update section. In other words, the loop does not have any explicit initialization, termination condition, or update expression. As a result, the loop condition is always considered true, and the loop continues indefinitely.

// Inside the loop body, the statement System.out.println("Apna College"); is executed repeatedly, printing the string "Apna College" to the console with each iteration of the loop.

// Since there is no exit condition or mechanism to break out of the loop, this code will continue to run indefinitely until manually terminated by an external intervention such as closing the program or interrupting the execution.
