Type conversion is a process where w can change the value with satisfying satements 
```byte to int is a conversion 
    int to float is a conversion
     ex: byte a = 10;//converting byte to integer 
         int b = a; //this is known as conversion which is converting the byte to int 
        System.out.println(b); 

Type casting is also a type of conversion here the satement should be given because those are unsatisfactroy statements
```int to byte 
   float to int 
    ex:  int a = 25;//casting int to byte b{because the value of every integer can't be a byte and the visevera is possible.}
        byte b = (byte) a;//byte range = -128 to +127 and the 257value is calcuated as it will divide the 257 with total range of the bytes that is 256 now 257/256 is '1' so it prints the value '1'
        System.out.println(b);

Type promotin is a type of conversion where it promotes the statement suppose we take that 
byte a = 10;
byte b = 30;
(a*b)
now if we want to perform any operator with which is value more than a range of byte then it will 
promote with the help of int 
now simply we can write int result = (a*b); and then print 
 int a = 10;
        float b = 10.5f;
        float result  = (a+b);//here it promotes the int to float which is decimal value 
        System.out.println(result);
