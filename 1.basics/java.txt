ide integrated development environment 

jdk java development kit 

jvm to run java application the jvm is must otherwise we can't run java
java is platform independent

jvm(java virtual machine)
but jvm is the platform is dependent 
jvm wants to built for particular os

jvm understands only bytecode(unreadable format for a humanbeing)

JRE java runtime environment 
inside jre we have jvm 

{jdk mostly used by developers}

wora:-write once and run anywere 

structure
instructure>>javacode>>>compiler(javac)>>>bytecode>>>jvm>>>JRE>>os(win,mac,anyother...)>>Hardware

assing the class with the name of file with .java 

first file lead to have main method also for the specific method signature
signature=Public static void main(String a[])  main(accept some parameters)

after we compile we get a newfile with hello.class that is a bytecode 
the extenstion for the bytecode is .class 

In Java the text(names) are known to be strings
numbers are stored with the help of int(integers)
println(prints in new line)
In java the semicolon is must for every line 
except we doesn't put semicolon at the end of the block 

In java we put the data-type(int,...) then vairable name(num, result ....) and then we assign the value 
example int num = 3;
the equal-to here is known as assignment operater.

addition of numbers 
public class addition{
public static void main(String arr[])
{
int num1 = 88;
int num2 = 12;
int result = num1+num2;
System.out.println(result);
}
}
then:-
compile 
run
