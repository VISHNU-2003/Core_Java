Loops:-
    Loops means if the work we want to do is that repeatedly then we itroduse the topic as looops 

    The main concept to know here is about is ITETATION
                Iterator in Java is an object used to cycle through arguments or elements present in a collection
                It is derived from the technical term “iterating,” which means looping through. Generally, an iterator in Java is used to loop through any collection of objects
   
         for the best example :-
                 if the teachers gives a homework to write for the same question for 100times then we used to wrtie
                 this  for 100times but in the concept of loops we can easily write this in few steps and we can give the conditons.
    
    There is a term known as Nested where the loop in loop where if the 1st loop is ended and it converse to the inside loop and then it will be come back and then keep and process ends that is known as "NESTED LOOP" 
    
                There are three types of loops in 
                         1.while loop
                         2.do..while loop 
                         3.for loop 
    
    1.while loop:-
        while loop condition is mostly used for the file reading and for databases used for while loop and aslo the syntax 
        of the while loop is 
                while(conditon){
                        system.out.println("..." + i)
                } 
                Nested while
                          int i = 1;
                                while(i<6)
                                {
                                System.out.println("I is " +  i);
                                i++;
                                int j = 1;
                                while(j<=3)//nested
                                {
                                        System.out.println("hello" + j);
                                        j++;
                                }
                                }
                                i++;

        2.do while LOOP:-
                do while loop is where there will be the output even the conditon doesn't satisfys though it will 
                print some thing 
                 syntax for do while looop is that 
                         do {
                                Systeom.out.println("a = " + a);
                                a++;
                                int j =1;
                                }while(a<=3);
                        NESTED LOOP:
                                  do {
                                        System.out.println("a = " + a);
                                        a++;
                                        int j =1;
                                        do{//nestedd
                                                System.out.println("j = " + j);
                                                j++;
                                        }while(j<=2);
                                        }while(a<=3);
                                }
        3.FOR LOOP: -
              in the case of for loop the syntax is too less and we can easily write the all conditions into the 
              same statement is known for the for loop conditon. 
              the syntax for the for loop is that : -
                blic static void main(String[] args){
                                for(int i=0;i<=5;i++)
                                {
                                System.out.println("hello " + i);
                                      
                                }
                        }
                NESTED FOR LOOP: -
                                
                                for(int i=0;i<=5;i++)
                                {
                                System.out.println("hello " + i);
                                        for(int j=1;j<=3;j++){//nested
                                        System.out.println("how are you " + j);
                                }
                                }
                        

This about the information regarding loops. 


**********************************************************************************************

The reason why a 'for' loop is not suitable for finding the greater number between two numbers is that a 'for' loop is typically used for iterating over a range of values or elements in a collection. it is not designed for comparing two numbers directly and determining which one is greater or lesser.

In the case of finding the greater number between two numbers, a simple 'if' statement provides a straightforward and efficient way to compare the values and return the greater number. The 'if' statement evaluates a condition ('a> b') and excutes the appropriate block of code based on the result of the condition. 

Using a 'for'loop or loops, for any task would introduce unnecessary complexity and would not provide any benefit over the straightforward 'if' statement approach.
